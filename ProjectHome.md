The Darwin Core is body of standards for sharing biodiversity information that include a set of terms, and recommendations on how to package and document them to facilitate data publication and sharing.   One recommendation defines a simple, text-based, exchange format.   A requirement of this format is an XML document, called a "metafile", that serves to describe the physical format and arrangement of published files.

This project provides a simple web application for data managers to use in order to generate and validate this metafile.  See the <a href='http://code.google.com/p/gbif-meta-maker/downloads/detail?name=GBIF-MetaMaker-Scoping.pdf&can=2&q='>scoping document</a> for this project.
