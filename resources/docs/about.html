The Darwin Core is body of standards for sharing biodiversity information that include a set of terms, and recommendations on how to package and document them to facilitate data publication and sharing. One recommendation defines a simple, text-based, exchange format. A requirement of this format is an XML document, called a "metafile", that serves to describe the physical format and arrangement of published files.
